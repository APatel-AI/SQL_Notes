# What is statistics ? 

- The field of statistics - the practice and study of collecting and analyzing data. 

- Two main branches of statistics
    - Descriptive/Summary statistics: describing or summarizing our data
    - Inferential statistics: collect a sample of data, and apply the results to the population that the sample represents

## Limitations of statistics
- Statistics requires specific, measurable questions
- We can't use statistics to find out WHY relationships exist.
