# What is statistics ? 

- The field of statistics - the practice and study of collecting and analyzing data. 

- Two main branches of statistics
    - Descriptive/Summary statistics: describing or summarizing our data
    - Inferential statistics: collect a sample of data, and apply the results to the population that the sample represents

## Limitations of statistics
- Statistics requires specific, measurable questions
- We can't use statistics to find out WHY relationships exist.

## Types of data: numeric
- Continuos data:
  - Stock prices
- Interval/count data:
  - How many cups of coffee do people drink per day ?
  
## Types of data: Categorical data
- Nominal data:
  - eye color
- Ordinal data:
  - How strongly do you agree that basketball is the best sport?

  
# Measures of center
## Why are measures of center useful ? 
- Terminology like "average", "most common", and "typical value" are all examples where measures of center are expressed in day to day life.

- Most common ways to calculate the center of the data
    - Measures of center: mean
        - mean = sum of all values / count of all values
     
    - Measures of center: median
        - Median - middle value for a given variable
        - median
            - sort the values from least to greatest
            - take the sum of the two middle values and divide by 2
         
    - Measure of center: mode
        - Mode: the most frequent value
     
  # Measure of spread
  ## why is spread important
  - Spread measures the variety of our data

  - Measures of spread
      - Range: range = maximum - minimum
      - Variance: variance = sum of squared values (we take the sqaureroot because of the negative values) / total values
      - To better undertand the variance we can calculate the standard deviation
         - Standard deviation: square root of the variance calculated.
         - The closer the standard deviation is to 0 the closer the data is clustered to the mean
      - Quartiles: splitting the data into 4 equal parts
